// Limiter: Recieves an object of limiter, used for limiting the number of request sent to this server
const limiter = rateLimit({
  max: 100,
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, //windowMs: window milliseconds
  message: 'Too many requests from that this IP, please try again in an hour',
});
app.use('/api', limiter); //this will affect all the routes withl '/api/

// STRIPE WEBHOOTS ROUTE
app.post(
  '/webhook-checkout',
  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }),
  bookingController.webhookCheckout,
); // the reason why we are putting the booking controller here is because The reason for that is that in this handler function, when we receive the body from Stripe, the Stripe function that we're then gonna use to actually read the body needs this body in a raw form, so basically as a string and not as JSON. Again, in this route here, we need the body coming with the request to be not in JSON, otherwise this is not going to be working at all. Now the thing is, that as soon as a request hits this middleware here, the body will be parsed and converted to JSON. It will then be put on request.body as a simple JSON object. Again with that, this route handler here would then not work. That's the whole reason why we need to put this route here before we call the express.raw. Now we still need to actually parse the body but in a so-called raw format.

// JSON MIDDLEWARE FROM EXPRESS
// app.use(
//   express.urlencoded({
//     extended: true,
//     limit: '10kb',
//   }),
// );
// Express built in middleware, so express.urlencoded, okay, and it's called this way because remember, the way that the form sends data to the server is actually also called URL encoded, and so here, we need that middleware to basically parse data coming from a URL encoded form. Then we pass in some settings, and we can say extended true, and that will simply allow us to pass some more complex data, which in this case is not really necessary, but still let's use it here, and we can also set the limit property as we did in the body parser, so up here, and so let's again say 10 kilobyte.

app.use(
  express.json({
    limit: '10kb', //when we have a body a body larger than 10kb, then it will not be accepted
  }),
); //When your server receives a request (like a POST or PUT request) where the client is sending data in JSON format (and the Content-Type header is set to application/json), this middleware steps in. It takes the raw JSON data from the request's body. It then parses this JSON data into a JavaScript object.Finally, it makes this JavaScript object available in your route handlers under req.body

// COOKIE PARSER
app.use(cookieParser()); //Parses the data from cookies

// DATA  SANITIZATION
// Data sanitization basically means to clean all the data that comes into the application from malicious code. So, code that is trying to attack our application. In this case, we're trying to defend against two attacks.

// i. Data Sanitization  against NoSQL query injection
app.use(mongoSanitize());
//So, what this middleware does is to look at the request body, the request query string, and also at Request.Params, and then it will basically filter out all of the dollar signs and dots, because that's how MongoDB operators are written. e. $

// ii. Data Sanitization  against NoSQL query injection
app.use(xss());
// This will then clean any user input from malicious HTML code, basically. Imagine that an attacker would try to insert some malicious HTML code with some JavaScript code attached to it. If that would then later be injected into our HTML site, it could really create some damage then. Using this middleware, we prevent that basically by converting all these HTML symbols. As I said before, the Mongoose validation itself is actually already a very good protection against XSS, because it won't really allow any crazy stuff to go into our database, as long as we use it correctly. Whenever you can, just add some validation to your Mongoose schemas, and that should mostly protect you you from cross-site scripting, at least on the server side.

// PREVENTING PARAMETER POLUTION
app.use(
  hpp({
    // the whitelist is simply an array of properties which we actually duplicates in the query string
    whitelist: [
      'duration',
      'ratingsAverage',
      'ratingsQuantity',
      'maxGroupSize',
      'difficulty',
      'price',
    ],
  }),
);

app.use(compression());

//CORS MIDDLEWARE
// app.use(cors());
// app.options('*', cors());

// CREATING OUR OWN MIDDLEWARE
// When making our own middleware, we have to call in the next function parameter otherwise the program will stop running and once a response is sent back, that is if a middleware is between a route, it and that route is called upon, the middleware will not get run because a response has ended the program
// JUST FOR EXPLANATION
// app.use((req, res, next) => {
//   console.log('Hello Leinad, I am the example for app.use() case');
//   next();

// });

// USING MIDDLEWARE TO SPOT THE TIME THE REQUEST HAPPENED
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.requestTime = new Date().toISOString();
  console.log(`App starts running at about ${req.requestTime}`);
  // console.log(req.cookies);//logging the cookies to the console
  next();
});

// ROUTES
// MOUNTING THE ROUTES FOR VIEWING THE WEBSITE ON THE SERVER SIDE
app.use('/', viewRouter);

// MOUNTING THE ROUTERS FOR DATA BASE MANAGEMNET
// Mouting the routers on the path at which the a url request is called upon
app.use('/api/v1/tours', tourRouter);
app.use('/api/v1/users', userRouter);
app.use('/api/v1/reviews', reviewRouter);

app.use('/api/v1/bookings', bookingRouter);
// And so again this router here that we're specifying now is basically a middleware that we mount upon this path. Okay? So whenever there is a request with a url that starts like this then this middleware function here will basically be called. And so that is then our router and in there just the slash route, so just the root basically will then be this API V1

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This middlewares will get run when it was not able to be handled by the route handlers middleware

// HANDLING UNKNOWN ROUTES
app.all('*', (req, res, next) => {
  // Using the imported AppErro class to handle the error
  next(new AppError(`Can't find ${req.originalUrl} on this server!`, 404));

  //So again, whenever we pass anything into next,  it will assume that it is an error, and it will then skip all the other middlewares in the middleware stack and sent the error that we passed in to our global error handling middleware, which will then, of course, be executed.
}); //Why did this work?
// So again the idea is that if we are able to reach this point here then it means that the request response cycle was not yet finished at this point in our code, right.Because remember that middleware is added to the middleware stack in the order that it's defined here in our code.And so basically this code here runs first,and so if the route was matched here in our tourRouter then our request would never even reach this code

// ERROR HANDLING MIDDLEWARE
// In express comes with middleware handlers out of the box So, to define an error handling middleware, all we need to do is to give the middleware function four arguments and Express will then automatically recognize it as an error handling middleware. And therefore, only call it when there is an error. And so just like in many other cases, this middleware function is an error first function,
// app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
//   err.statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
//   err.status = err.status || 'error'

//   res.status(err.statusCode).json({
//     status: err.status,
//     message: err.message
//   })
// }) Later placed in the errorController.js file
app.use(globalErrorHandler);

// EXPORTING THE EXPRESS APP, To be used in the server.js file
module.exports = app;

// STATUS CODE
// 200 = OK
// 201 = CREATED
// 204 = NO CONTENT
// 500 = Internal server error
